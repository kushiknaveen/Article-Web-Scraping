# Article-Web-Scraping

The web scraping project extracts articles from The Guardian website. 
Using Python libraries like Requests and BeautifulSoup, it accesses The Guardian's webpage, parses the HTML content, and extracts relevant information from articles. 
This could include article titles, authors, publication dates, and the article content itself. By automating the process of fetching articles, the project provides a convenient way to gather information from The Guardian for analysis, research, or other purposes. 
With appropriate error handling and data processing, the project ensures reliable extraction of articles, contributing to efficient information retrieval from The Guardian's online platform.
